# Automation-With-Vagrant

In this project we’re going to use Vagrant and VirtualBox, which are two programs that help you work with virtual machines.

What you’ll need
You need a computer with 8GB RAM and approximately ~10GB free disk space, because we’re going to be running Linux in a virtual machine.

You can use Windows, Mac or Linux. The software we’ll be using, VirtualBox and Vagrant, is available for all these platforms.
